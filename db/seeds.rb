# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# 10.times do |item|
#   Portfolio.create!(title: "Portfolio Title #{item}", subtitle: "Subtitle portfolio", body: "Some Body Text", main_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/600x400", thumb_image: "https://via.placeholder.com/300x150", text: "Some text")
# end

# puts "10 Portfolio items created successfully!"

# 8.times do |blog| 
#   Blog.create!()
# end

# puts "8 Blog items created successfully!"
